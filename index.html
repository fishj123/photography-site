                    <span>Hello, my name is Jack Fisher and I am a hobbyist photographer from Edinburgh. I have been doing photography for roughly 3 years now, mainly shooting around Edinburgh and whilst on my travels. I shoot both digital and film, with no particular style or thought behind what I am doing. Recently I have been doing more film photography, than digital. I've been using an Olympus XA-2 and an Olympus OM-1 for all of my film photography. Every photo on this website was taken by me. I also created this site, as a way to practice my web development skills. If you are interested in seeing more of my photography you can find me on Instagram - _jack_fisher. </span>
